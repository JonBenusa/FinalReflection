Assignment 8 Observations

This program was relatively easy to write since I have already done something similar in Information and Technology Security.
The only difference is that this time the length of the password didn't vary. 
I was kind of surpried that slightly more than doubling the char set made such a big difference with such a small password length.
Overall, this assignment only took about 2 hours, since I took my old program as a starting point and edited it to match your constraints.
