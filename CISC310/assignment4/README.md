# This code calculates the address page number and offset from a given decimal address. It assumes a 32-bit virtual memory address with a 4-KB page size
# outputs the results to output.txt

This assignment was relatively easy for me. It only took about a hour and a half. It was a good refresher on how the address of data is stored in a file system. It didnâ€™t pose any big 
problems this time that I had to work around, and I believe that my code worked on my first try.
