# This program makes a simple buddy buffer manager with 4 functions for an operating system and a test driver.

Overall, the assignment took me 22 hours to complete. I learned a lot more about how buffers are managed. Upon looking closely at how to make a buddy buffer I realized just how complex this 
code actually is. I ran into problems a couple of times with incorrect indexes leading to the buffers being moved to the wrong level. It gave me quite the headache a couple times where I 
needed to physically map out a couple examples on paper before I could even attempt to come up with the correct logic for the recombining as well. It was definitely the most difficult 
assignment in this class so far. I am very happy that I listened to your advice and started early.
