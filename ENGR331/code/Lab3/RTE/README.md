    READ the HD44780LCD Datasheet and the Lecture Notes 6.
    Write a message on the two lines. Each line of your LCD is 16 character long. 
    The LCD.c file has function prototypes and skeleton code for the following functions you might find useful. These are suggestions - you MAY create functions in anyway that allows you to accomplish the task of communicating and sending a variety of messages on the screen
