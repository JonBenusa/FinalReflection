# FinalReflection
As I approach graduation, I’m filled with a mix of excitement and reflection. Studying computer science has been a journey through algorithms, programming, and problem-solving. For years, I wondered how this technical knowledge would translate into real-world impact. Now, as I begin a career developing software for utility companies, I have my answer.

Helping protect linemen—those who risk their lives to maintain our power infrastructure—gives deep purpose to my work. Through software, I can improve safety, streamline operations, and enhance decision-making in the field.

Using data analysis and machine learning, we can identify patterns, predict risks, and prioritize preventative action. With user-friendly tools, linemen can access real-time information, make informed decisions, and stay safe. Strong communication systems will further ensure timely coordination during critical operations.

Reflecting on my time in computer science, I’m grateful for the knowledge I’ve gained and the opportunity to apply it toward something meaningful. As I enter the professional world, I do so with purpose: to use technology in service of those who keep our communities running—one line of code at a time.
